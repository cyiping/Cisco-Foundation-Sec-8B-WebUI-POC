# Welcome to the Cisco Foundation AI Cookbook
This cookbook repository helps you get started with using models developed by Cisco Foundation AI team. <br>
It will cover many security related use cases, deployment options, practical adaption approaches like finetuning and so forth.
For a high-level overview of the cookbook, please refer to our [blog post of introduction to the cookbook](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/foundation-sec-8b-language-model-cybersecurity-introduction-cookbook-l9tsc).
